<p class="c70 c38"><span class="c9">Since the beginning of the What Works Cities project, the Sunlight Foundation</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;(Sunlight)</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;has worked with over 50 US City Halls to enact open data policies, and has tracked open data policy in &nbsp;over 100 cities, counties, and states nationwide. </span><span class="c9">We designed</span><span class="c32 c36">&nbsp;</span><span class="c11">Tactical Data Engagement</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;to help cities go beyond simply making data </span><span class="c9 c18">legally</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;or </span><span class="c9 c18">technically</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;public to actually putting</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;open data in the hands of community actors </span><span class="c9">who can </span><span class="c9 c18">use </span><span class="c9">it to advance common local goals</span><span class="c9">.</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3 class="c70 c38" id="h.usoe5wqaztdh"><span class="c64 c9 c29 c76 c18">Why did we create Tactical Data Engagement?</span></h3>
<p class="c70 c38"><span class="c9">The </span><span class="c9">Sunlight </span><span class="c9">Foundation</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;</span><span class="c9">believes that open data is only effective in furthering transparency and accountability when residents use</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;it</span><span class="c9">.</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;</span><span class="c9">We&rsquo;ve worked</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;closely with cities </span><span class="c9">track</span><span class="c9">ing</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;their best practices for engaging users around data and, in writing this guide, wanted to join those insights with actionable steps for cities to follow in pursuit of successful community use of open data. O</span><span class="c9">ur hope is to revolutionize the way governments think about open data</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;as an opportunity for productive partnership and collaboration</span><span class="c9">. </span><span class="c9">State and local governments </span><span class="c9">need strategies for interacting with communities to encourage the active use of open data.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt12" id="cmnt_ref12">[l]</a></sup><span class="c9">&nbsp;These strategies would have the potential to activate and empower community practitioners, residents, and data users to</span><span class="c9 c18">&nbsp;</span><span class="c9">use city data for issues that community members </span><span class="c9 c18">uniquely </span><span class="c9">recognize. </span><span class="c9">We believe that open governments today have a rare opportunity to expand the power of open data to solve local problems.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt13" id="cmnt_ref13">[m]</a></sup></p>
<p class="c40 c38"><span class="c9">In the past, </span><span class="c9">Sunlight has supported many cities in developing the foundations of open data through policies and portals to promote government transparency. These efforts have fostered and proliferated </span><span class="c9 c18">access</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;to government data across the nation. This access is critical democratic infrastructure. However, to fully engender openness, governments need to build upon this infrastructure of access to facilitate productive </span><span class="c9">re-</span><span class="c9">use of public information. Most governments, after all, undertake open data initiatives to demonstrate open data&rsquo;s capacity to affect positive change. Open data policies and portals are important foundations, but it&rsquo;s clear cities need to go </span><span class="c9">further</span><sup><a href="#cmnt14" id="cmnt_ref14">[n]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt15" id="cmnt_ref15">[o]</a></sup><span class="c9">.</span></p>
<h3 class="c38 c40" id="h.dnk5xosd3v53"><span class="c9 c29">Who is this guide for? </span></h3>
<p class="c31"><span class="c9 c10">The primary audience for this guide includes local government officials and administrators who want to get more than a policy and portal out of their open data program. The process steps apply to local governments that are ready to engage with stakeholder expertise to add value and create opportunities for their communities by making public data more usable. T</span><span class="c16 c9 c10">he research on city-specific government approaches in this guide should also be able to meet the needs of regional, state, or federal governments. </span></p>
<p class="c31 c19"><span class="c16 c9 c10"></span></p>
<p class="c31"><span class="c9 c10">Although it was designed to guide government actors, we also hope that Tactical Data Engagement will help advocates, researchers, librarians, organizers, and </span><span class="c9 c10">residents achieve their goals by creating an </span><span class="c9 c10">avenue</span><sup><a href="#cmnt16" id="cmnt_ref16">[p]</a></sup><span class="c9 c10">&nbsp;for governments and community organizations to work together.</span><span class="c9 c10">&nbsp;</span><span class="c9 c10">Those with strong roots in communities should feel free to adopt various elements of facilitating open data&rsquo;s re-use from this guide, even without the involvement of city hall. </span><span class="c9 c10">This guide underscores that listening to residents is at the heart of being a transparent open government, and resident participation in government decision-making keeps government accountable.</span><span class="c9 c10">&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2 class="c23" id="h.rpky71gdotww"><span class="c37">What is</span><span class="c37">&nbsp;Tactical Data Engagement</span><span class="c37">?</span></h2>
<p class="c7"><span class="c9 c18 c46">Tactical Data Engagement is a collaborative approach that teaches governments how to facilitate the community use of open data.</span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c9">It&rsquo;</span><span class="c9">s a set of </span><span class="c9">process steps</span><sup><a href="#cmnt19" id="cmnt_ref19">[s]</a></sup><span class="c9">&nbsp;developed based on concepts of human-centered design that guide governments on how to successfully engage with residents around open data to productive ends. </span><span class="c9">We provide readers with tactics, drawn from examples in cities around the country, to ensure that the process steps and the approach as a whole </span><span class="c9">are possible within the constraints of realistic community and government internal capacity. As opposed to seeking to an expensive, or impossible &quot;perfect&quot; solution, Tactical Data Engagement&rsquo;s impact might be incremental and can be iterated and built upon.</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;</span><span class="c9">Thanks to Sunlight&rsquo;s suggested tactics, the process can be </span><span class="c16 c9 c1">lightweight, adaptable, incremental, inexpensive, targeted, strategic, and can be built upon.</span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c9">The goal of the Tactical Data Engagement approach is to facilitate the community use of open &nbsp;data. Community use of open data is the use of </span><span class="c9 c18">locally specific </span><span class="c9">information to address </span><span class="c9 c18">locally specific </span><span class="c9">issues</span><span class="c9">. </span><span class="c16 c9 c1">Community actors may need public data both in its raw form and as qualitative information to have an evidence base for understanding local challenges. We see these community challenges as opportunities for governments to consolidate interest around an issue and facilitate the community use of open data to address that issue. </span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c9 c29 c52 c18">&hellip; and why should I use </span><span class="c9 c29 c52 c18">it</span><sup><a href="#cmnt20" id="cmnt_ref20">[t]</a></sup><span class="c64 c9 c29 c52 c18">?</span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c9">It&rsquo;s</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;important for city halls and government agencies at all levels to have a firm grasp on the value-add that Tactical Data Engagement provides. Tactical Data Engagement as an approach has the potential to take </span><span class="c9 c18">your </span><span class="c9">open data program to the next level. This approach can help governments that have various elements of an open data program, but are still searching for ways to generate impact and success stories in communities. The process steps that make up the approach are lightweight and adaptable. They can take conversations and ideas that may have circulated in your government&rsquo;s offices and turn them into a solidified effort with opportunities for iteration and sustainability. This approach will help you reveal and leverage the impact of existing activities in your city. </span></p>

<p class="c6"><span class="c16 c9 c1">Below we walk you through the steps of the Tactical Data Engagement process and how you can use them. We intend for these steps to sound familiar if your organization has strategies in place for community engagement or data partnerships in the community. The steps should add another layer of integrity to your strategic efforts by ensuring that open data plays a part in collaborations outside of government, and that data-driven projects incorporate the real needs of residents, specifically when projects aim to address issues predominant in disadvantaged communities. These steps, and the approach as a whole, demonstrate how to facilitate the effective community use of open data, and should lead you to empower community members across industries and backgrounds to participate in local decision-making. </span></p>

<p class="c6"><span class="c9">Refining a specific opportunity based on specific community feedback is what differentiates a general strategic priority from a community-driven priority. This part is particularly important: Communities that have systematically </span><span class="c9">been underrepresented </span><span class="c9">in decision-making should have </span><span class="c9">a seat at the table</span><span class="c16 c9 c1">&nbsp;to inform city efforts. Specifically, communities of color and economically disadvantaged communities are often most deeply affected by any issues that cities may hope to address. When framing a specific scenario with potential impact in the community, you should consider having direct and focused conversations with members of these or other communities with particular insight into your local issue area. Doing so ensures that any solutions generated by the Tactical Data Engagement approach actually meet community needs. </span></p>

<p class="c31"><span class="c16 c9 c10">THE DESCRIPTION: Collaborative planning with communities is a tool that many cities and governments already use to solicit feedback, for example planning departments might ask for feedback on a city&rsquo;s comprehensive plan, Congress might ask for feedback on a policy plan, or housing agencies might ask for input when planning new real estate developments. Planning alongside members of the community entails bringing a draft plan while remaining open to input and establishing that feedback from residents will be incorporated into plans. In the context of Tactical Data Engagement, a plan that hasn&rsquo;t been reviewed by residents is more likely to be ineffective. </span></p>
<p class="c31 c19"><span class="c16 c9 c10"></span></p>
<p class="c31"><span class="c16 c9 c10">Generating a draft plan in the first place, may be an original process unique to your organization, or may build off of open plans from other cities that address similar opportunities as your chosen opportunity. Once you have a draft, there are a number of tactics to get it out in the open (including those suggested below). Be mindful of the audience from whom you would like to solicit feedback. In groups with varied skills and backgrounds, low-tech solutions often work best, for example doing physical activities with note cards, sticky notes, or markers to solicit detailed notes on your proposed plan rather than relying on data expertise. </span></p>

</ol>
<p class="c31 c61"><span class="c16 c9 c1">THE DEFINITION: Taking action after communicating the opportunity for collaboration to relevant community stakeholders and organizations. </span></p>
<p class="c31 c61 c19"><span class="c16 c9 c1"></span></p>
<p class="c31 c61"><span class="c9">THE DESCRIPTION: Each of the </span><span class="c9">tactics we&rsquo;ve developed</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;to help carry out this step is centered around an effort that requires active stakeholder engagement with city data around an identified opportunity. At this stage in the Tactical Data Engagement process, government staff should be prepared to provide new data, assist with resources, assist with implementation, create a new product, or implement a community-created product. </span><span class="c9">In the most straightforward cases, the opportunity to facilitate re-use may mean sharing datasets that are not currently available in formats and with contents that best suit the needs of the requesters to solve local issues. Alternatively, the opportunity could involve helping community residents access data about their interactions with the city</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;&mdash;</span><span class="c16 c9 c1">&nbsp;for example, connecting local business owners with more accessible permitting and zoning information to drive economic development, or helping parents better understand school options by providing data-driven neighborhood context to improve education outcomes. If your project is aimed at building a new high-tech or low-tech tool, commit to iterative user testing throughout the process. It&rsquo;s important to take into account that the first solution may not always be the best one and that those members of the community who contributed to the ideation of this project have valuable insight into any product&rsquo;s usability. </span></p>
<p class="c31 c19 c61"><span class="c16 c9 c1"></span></p>
<p class="c31 c61"><span class="c16 c9 c1">The crux of this step is realizing that an intervention that helps community members better use open data will not instantaneously improve issues like blight or education, but rather that a more community-informed and more data-driven approach to problem-solving will move the needle on these issues in the long-run. </span></p>
<p class="c31 c61 c19"><span class="c16 c9 c1"></span></p>
<p class="c31 c61"><span class="c9">THE RESULT: A </span><span class="c32 c36">product, tool, or completed project</span><span class="c16 c9 c1">&nbsp;where community members were able to use new open data or use existing public data in a new way thanks to intervention by and partnership with governments or data providers. </span></p>

I think this para sets a general tone on what cities do with gov, and the previous para establishes the work that Sunlight has done with cities.</span></p>

    <p class="c30"><a href="#cmnt_ref15" id="cmnt15">[o]</a><span class="c16 c24 c10">I also think that this paragraph is a &quot;stretch&quot; of the previous paragraph.

    <p class="c30"><a href="#cmnt_ref20" id="cmnt20">[t]</a><span class="c16 c24 c10">Not sure if this has been discussed already, but I was thinking on having a high utility if this is made a separate section. A city official will be *most* interested in a section like this. </span></p>
    <p class="c14"><span class="c16 c24 c10"></span></p>
    <p class="c30"><span class="c16 c24 c10">I also feel like adding an example inside this section will be helpful. E.g. &quot;The City of Pittsburgh leveraged community use of x,y,z data in order to create a,b,c impact.&quot; This might propel the official to start thinking about *why* he/she should be interested in this guide. Just a thought!</span></p>

    <p class="c30"><span class="c16 c24 c10">EDIT: I saw that there is a section in the end that covers the case studies, but will be good to summarize a case study in a couple of lines to create impact here. :)</span></p>

    <p class="c30"><a href="#cmnt_ref23" id="cmnt23">[w]</a><span class="c16 c24 c10">Wondering if there&#39;s an overlap between this tactic and the first tactic. What&#39;s the difference between stakeholders recognized in the first and third tactics?</span></p>

    <p class="c30"><span class="c16 c24 c10">EDIT: My understanding is that the suggested tactics don&#39;t follow an order, right? If that is the case, then we should specify that *that* is the case right before the table starts.</span></p>

    <p class="c30"><a href="#cmnt_ref24" id="cmnt24">[x]</a><span class="c16 c24 c10">I think these are different tactics in that they are meant to identify two types of partners, &quot;community partners&quot; - one&#39;s whose motivation/vision is based on social impact, while the other &quot;business partners&quot; - are those whose business objectives align with those of your community partners</span></p>

    <p class="c30"><a href="#cmnt_ref26" id="cmnt26">[z]</a><span class="c16 c24 c10">It seems that from Step 1 to Step 2 there is an assumption that these gov officials have gone through the process of figuring out who the right people at the table are/ should be. &nbsp;Is there perhaps some process or some suggestions Sunlight may have on who and how they get people to the table? &nbsp;Thinking about marginalized communities is a good first step, but there are specific interest groups within and amongst this larger umbrella. &nbsp;For example you can think of a neighborhood association vs. a fair housing group (one is mostly made up of home-owners, another is mostly made up of people who generally rent)...</span></p>
